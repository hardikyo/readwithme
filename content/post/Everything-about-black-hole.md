# What Is A Black Hole

Hello friends welcome to your information zone where we bring you important and interesting information from fields like science, technology, national and international politics, economy, online earning and travel and tourism. Today in this article we will talk about Black Hole, an important topic of astronomy, what it is and how it is formed.

What is Black Hole ?

A black hole is a very dense place in space, under which no object of its size can escape from it. Whatever comes within the black hole's event horizon is attracted to it due to the unimaginably strong gravity of the black hole. The Event Horizon of a black hole is the threshold around it, beyond which everything is attracted by the black hole's gravitational force.

No laws of physics apply to a black hole. due to extreme gravity

to the extreme gravity, even the light from here cannot return back, that is why the black hole is shown as a black sphere. Talking about the formation of black holes, it is believed that black holes are formed by such massive stars, which are in the last stage of their lifetime. Therefore, before understanding the formation of a black hole, it becomes important for us to understand the entire life cycle of a star.

Event Horizon of a Black Hole

It can be understood by the escape velocity of an object. Escape velocity is the speed that an object needs to escape the gravitational pull of a black hole. As an object gets closer to the black hole, the force of gravity on it becomes stronger and it needs more escape velocity.

Event Horizon is the place where an object is placed

at the speed of light to escape the strong gravity

Even more speed is required. Since Einstein

Special Theory of Relativity

The Event Horizon is the place where an object needs a speed greater than the speed of light to get out of strong gravity. Since according to Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, nothing can move faster than the speed of light in space. So this means that the event horizon of a black hole is a point from which nothing can come back.

star formation

Not only are there trillions of stars in a galaxy, but they also contain vast amounts of gas and dust, called nebulae. The gases present in this nebula contain the largest amount of hydrogen and helium molecules. These regions of gas and dust in the Milky Way are located in the interstellar space.

These clouds of gas and dust gradually come together and move in the shape of a disc. Gradually all the mass starts gathering towards the center of the disc. And due to its own gravitational force, a phenomenon like nuclear fusion takes place in the center and a star is formed.

life of stars

Any object in the universe would have a definite life span. Similarly, the planets, galaxies and stars visible to us in space also have a fixed life span. The Sun is also a star, the main source of energy on our earth. These stars continue to generate energy throughout life, due to which they appear to us to shine. The heat and light coming from the Sun are also part of this energy.

Energy is needed to do any work and fuel is necessary to generate energy, similarly hydrogen is found in the form of fuel in stars, which generates energy by the process of nuclear fusion and the same energy is also given to us. Received in the form of light and heat.

Nuclear Fusion: The Energy of Stars

Nuclear fusion is a physical phenomenon in which two lighter nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus. A huge amount of energy is released in this whole process. Energy is created by this process in stars. Here hydrogen is heated to a very high temperature and changes from gas to plasma, due to this the electromagnetic force between the electron and the nucleus inside the hydrogen atom weakens and the electrons present in the atom are separated from the nucleus.

Apart from this, due to the extreme temperature, these nuclei move very close to each other, due to which the repulsive force between the two positive nuclei also becomes weaker than the strong nuclear forces and the two nuclei fuse

For example, in stars, two isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium (one proton and one neutron) and tritium (one proton and two neutrons) combine to form a helium nucleus (two protons and two neutrons). A neutron and a lot of energy is released.

Since two hydrogen nuclei have more mass than one helium nucleus, the mass remaining after fusion is converted into energy according to Einstein's formula E=mc2. The light and heat we get from the Sun are examples of this energy. In addition, in the process of nuclear fission, a heavy nucleus breaks down into elements with two smaller nuclei. In nuclear power plants electricity is made by this technology.

death of stars

Since the existence of stars is due to the fuel present in them, which gradually decreases with time. A research has shown that, almost half the fuel of the Sun has been exhausted, so now the Sun will only exist for 5 billion years and will be able to give light to the Earth. Let us now know how a star dies? There are mainly two forces acting in a star, one is gravity which is applied towards the center of the star and the other force exerted outward due to the immense energy released in case of nuclear fusion.

Due to these two forces, the star is able to remain in a balanced state. When the star starts running out of fuel, the force exerted by the nuclear energy from outside also becomes less than before, whereas the gravitational force is same as before, in such a situation the force of gravity becomes more powerful and it forces the star inside. And starts shrinking. The death and subsequent position of any star depends on the mass of the star. We have explained their death by dividing these stars into three categories (low mass, medium mass and high mass).

#### Nuclear fusion not only prevents stars from collapsing, but it also created elements that never existed before. Depending on their size, stars can form the element through fusion to Iron (Fe), which has an atomic number of 26. Significantly, there are 118 elements in the periodic table, so other elements are formed at the time of the death of a star, which we will learn about later.

death of light stars

The smallest stars are too large to be considered planets, while too small to be considered stars, they are unable to sustain the fusion of hydrogen due to their low mass and are referred to as "failed stars". Small slow-burning red dwarf stars have very long lives, between about one and ten trillion years.

Scientists believe that, when small stars die, they turn into white dwarf stars. These are very dense stars, which do not burn fuel. After this, these stars cool down and turn into black dwarf stars.

death of medium stars

When medium-sized stars, such as the Sun, run out of hydrogen as fuel, their cores shrink and heat up, causing the outer layers of gas to expand and the stars to become red giant stars. Huh. Eventually when the core of a red giant star cools, the remaining gas expands into space, forming Planetary. Nebula is formed. Its center is also a white star or White Dwarf.

Death of giant stars.

Giant stars (1.4 times or more as massive as the Sun) die in a much shorter period of time than smaller stars, mainly because of their high mass, due to which their gravitational force is very high, and the stars need to balance this force. Nuclear fusion occurs very rapidly in the core and such stars lose all their fuel in a very short time.

Unlike smaller stars, when hydrogen is depleted in these stars, due to extreme gravity, helium nuclei fuse to form larger elements, this process continues until iron is formed as the last element in the core.

After iron, there is no further fusion in these, in which case the star begins to shrink due to its gravity and due to this the iron present in the core becomes very hot. The force of gravity is so strong that the electrons and protons of iron present in the star core combine to form neutrons. In less than a second, the iron core the size of our Earth turns into a neutron core with a radius of about 6 miles (10 kilometers).

The shrinking of the star heats the core to billions of degrees and results in a terrifying explosion in the universe, which we know as a supernova. After this, the remaining core forms a neutron star and if its size is very large, it turns into a black hole.

Chandrashekhar Limit

1930 In Indian Physical Scientist

(Astrophysicist) Subramaniam Chandrasekhar stated that, if the mass of a star is 1.4 times or more than the mass of the Sun, then such stars will be destroyed by a supernova-like event and depending on their mass will be converted into neutron stars or black holes. This limit was named Chandrasekhar limit after him and for this he was also awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in the year 1983.


Neutron Capture Process: Of Large Elements

Construction

The initial explosion of a supernova has so much energy that it can split atoms in the core. In the moments after the explosion, neutron particles begin to flow from the iron core. These neutrons with high velocity collide with lighter nuclei to form heavier nuclei. The nucleosynthesis that occurs during the explosion of a supernova produces elements with atomic numbers higher than iron, which cannot be produced by nuclear fusion. At the beginning of the universe, many new elements, including gold, were created due to the destruction of stars in this way.

Nobel for the discovery of black holes

In the year 2020, three physicists Sir Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez were awarded the Nobel Prize for the discovery of black holes. Although the black hole was conceived by Einstein, Roger Penrose verified this hypothesis by mathematical representations of the theory of relativity.

In January 1965, ten years after Einstein's death, Roger Penrose proved that black holes could indeed form and described them in detail. Apart from this, two other scientists were given this award for the discovery of a very heavy object in the middle of our Galaxy. Point to be noted is that. That, this massive object can only be explained by a black hole.
